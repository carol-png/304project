@conference{oldford1999MentalModels,
	Abstract = {The debate about the appropriate computer human in-
terface (direct manipulation versus command line) is
an old one and a false one. That it regularly arises is a
consequence of inappropriate software design. An ideally
designed system would freely mix the two.
D.A. Norman's (1988) Design of Everyday Things is
condensed to ve essential principles which are applica-
ble to the design of interactive statistical systems. These
are described and illustrated by the design of the exper-
imental statistical software system called Quail. While
the principles apply types of interface they are illustrated
primarily for a direct manipulation one.
Examination of these principles continually points to
the value of modelling statistical concepts directly in the
base software system. It is argued that such a system
would be well positioned to freely mix interface styles to
best suit the analysis.},

@article{BeauLotto2002609,
	Abstract = {Rationalizing the perceptual effects of spectral stimuli has been a major challenge in vision science for at least the last 200 years. Here we review evidence that this otherwise puzzling body of phenomenology is generated by an empirical strategy of perception in which the color an observer sees is entirely determined by the probability distribution of the possible sources of the stimulus. The rationale for this strategy in color vision, as in other visual perceptual domains, is the inherent ambiguity of the real-world origins of any spectral stimulus. },

@article{HowePurves2005,
	Abstract = {Visual stimuli that entail the intersection of two or more straight lines elicit a variety of well known perceptual anomalies. Preeminent among these anomalies are the systematic overestimation of acute angles, the underestimation of obtuse angles, and the misperceptions of line orientation exemplified in the classical tilt, Z{\"o}llner, and Hering illusions. Here we show that the probability distributions of the possible real-world sources of projected lines and angles derived from a range-image database of natural scenes accurately predict each of these perceptual peculiarities. These findings imply that the perception of angles and oriented lines is determined by the statistical relationship between geometrical stimuli and their physical sources in typical visual environments.},
